# cryptanalysis-of-caesar-cipher
Network Security Term Project
Aim of this project is developing a program for cryptanalyzing a text that encrytpted with the caesar cipher 
How does it work?
To cryptanalyzing a Caesar cipher, I will start by creating a text file containing the cipher text.
Then, I will read the file and try all 25 possible shifts on the text. 
For each of the resulting plain texts, I will count the number of meaningful words it contains.
Once I have tried all 25 shifts, I will choose the plain text that contains the most meaningful words and write both the plain text and its shift to a new text file.
